If you fancy this snake :) 

Here are the steps to set up this fancy snake in your profile page:

You will need to build a repository the same name as your username first. 

Under this repo you will create a readme.md file. 

Under this repo you will need to create a work flow with the .yml file. 

The yml code is within this folder. 

Have fun. :)

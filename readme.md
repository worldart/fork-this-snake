If you fancy this snake :)

Here are the steps to set up the snake in your profile page.

You will need to build a repository the same name as your username. 

Under this repo you will create a readme.md file. 

Under this repo you will need to create a work flow with the .yml file. 

The yml code is within this folder. 

Have fun. :)
